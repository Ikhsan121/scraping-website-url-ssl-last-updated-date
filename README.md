# scraping-website-url-ssl-last-updated-date
This is a partial solution from a client. The client needs to set up a google sheet which has 3 columns - website url - ssl - last update date.

After I fill in the url, I need it to auto-update the other 2 columns with the ssl expiry (either yes or no, or how many days until the certificate expires), then the date the web page was last updated.

I would then like to add some conditional filtering based on the fields in the table, e.g. if the website was last updated more than 60 days we highlight it in red, or if the ssl expires less than 14 days highlight it in red, etc.
